## Contributing to rmhmc

### Reporting issues

If you find a bug or other unexpected behavior while using `rmhmc`,
open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dfm/rmhmc/issues)
and we will try to respond and (hopefully) solve the problem in a timely manner.
Similarly, if you have a feature request or question about the library, the best
place to post those is currently on GitHub as an issue, but that is likely
change if the user community grows. If you report an issue, please give the
details needed to reproduce the problem (version of exoplanet, its dependencies,
and your platform) and a small standalone piece of code that demonstrates the
problem clearly.

### Contributing code

We welcome contributions to the codebase of all scales from typo fixes to new features,
but if you would like to add a substantial feature, it would be a good idea to first
open an issue that describes your plan so that we can discuss in advance.
